First, I used Card(new) to show some KPIs.

Second, I used to slicers to filter by Job Title, Job Country or Both.

Third, I made a field parameter to select between Job Percent measure or Job Count measure. And I used this parameter in a Stacked Bar Chart contain the skills in the y-axis and switch between the fields through the parameter slicer.

Forth, I made another field parameter to select between Median Yearly Salary measure or Median Hourly Salary measure. And I used this parameter in a Stacked Bar Chart contain the job title in the y-axis and switch between the fields through the parameter slicer.

Finally, I made a Clear Slicers button to clear all slicers.
